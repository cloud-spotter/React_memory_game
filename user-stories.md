# Purpose

The following user stories define the desired behaviour and requirements of the Memory Game, focusing on the player's interaction with the game interface and gameplay mechanics, and serving as a roadmap for the game's development.

# User Stories

### Game Initialisation:

- As a player, I want to see a grid of cards (with an even number of cards) when I start the game, so that I know the game board is ready.

### Card Flipping:

- As a player, when I click on a card, I want it to flip over, so that I can see what is on the other side.
- As a player, I want to be able to flip two cards at a time, so that I can try to find a matching pair.

### Matching Mechanism:

- As a player, when I flip two identical cards consecutively, I want them to remain face up or be removed from the board, so that I can visually track my progress and focus on uncovering the remaining pairs.
- As a player, when two flipped cards are not a match, they should automatically flip back after a brief delay, so that I can remember their positions and try again.

### Game Completion:

- As a player, once all pairs are matched, I want to see a message indicating that I have completed the game, so that I know I have finished.

### Restarting the Game:

- As a player, I want to be able to restart the game at any time, so that I can play again from the beginning.

### User Interface:

- As a player, I want the cards to be visually distinct when they are face down and when they are flipped, so that I can easily tell the state of each card.
- As a player, I want the interface to be simple and intuitive, so that I can focus on the game without distractions.

### Card Shuffle:

- As a player, I want the cards to be shuffled randomly each time I start a new game, so that each game presents a new challenge.

### Error Prevention:

- As a player, I should not be able to flip more than two cards at a time, to prevent any confusion or errors in the gameplay.

### Visual Feedback:

- As a player, I want to receive visual feedback when a match is found or when two cards do not match, so that I am clearly informed about the outcome of my actions.
